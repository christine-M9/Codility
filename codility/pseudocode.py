#define a function that takes a list R as input
#Loop through elements of list R
#calculate indicator for current pothole and update max indicator if its larger and reset p.d and p.c
#use else if the current seg contains potholes to update p.d to be max depth and increment p.c to account for the consecutive potholes
#return max indicator
